## How To Play Blackjack?
- Equally well known as Twenty-One. The rules are simple, the play is thrilling, and there is opportunity for high strategy.

- Player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

**Stand :**  If your first two cards are acceptable, you can stand and the dealer will move on to the next player.

**Hit :**  If you would like more cards to improve your hand total, the dealer will deal you more cards, one at a time, until you either bust (go over 21) or you choose to stand. There is no limit on the number of cards you can take (other than going over a total of 21).
